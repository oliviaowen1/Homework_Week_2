## Code Refactor

## Project Overview
For this assignment, i had to take the Horiseon website and refactor the code, to ensure it works and is written efficiently as well as ensuring that is meets the accessibility criteria.
Websites need to ensure that they meet the accessibility criteria, to ensure that all web-users are able to view and use the website with the same ease and use all of the functions in full.

## Features of my project
In order to ensure i met this criteria, i had to first ensure that the code was working efficiently. This meant that i had add IDs in to the HTML file in order to ensure the Nav Bar buttons worked. 
I also provided the document with a simple title, that explained quickly and easily which website was open. 
The CSS file provided for the website was working fully, however it was written across many lines, often repeating information that could be simplified. As many classes, IDs and attributes had the same styling, i was able to move these all on to one line, seperated by commas, in order to give them all the same style.

In order to make the website more accessible, i have added a few things to help this. The first being all images now have alt attributes. This means that should an image be unavailable to show, the alternative text will show instead. I aimed to use names to describe or best identify the image, as those using speech enabled websites or screenreaders will then be able to know what the image is without needing to see it. 
I have also added pseudo-classes that mean the text is highlighted as well as made larger when it is hovered over. Those using keyboard buttons to navigate through website will be able to clearly see where they are on the page as this will change to yellow once it is focused on, it will also do this once it is hovered over with the mouse and will assist those that may have sight impairments. When viewing the text on the page, this will also highlight in yellow once hovered over and increase in size, again allowing users to view this more easily should they be unable to read the smaller text. 
You are able to see an example of this in the screenshot below:

## Potential improvements
Should i do this project again, i would like to include JavaScript, so i would be able to click a button to change the CSS styling of the page, this would make every element larger so that people had the choice which size they viewed the page in, as well as change the colour so that those who may be colourblind, visually impaired or need extra help are able to use the website with more ease and it is more inclusive.
